# Real-Time Virtual Paint Application

## Overview
This project is a real-time virtual paint application developed using computer vision techniques and OpenCV. The application allows users to paint in mid-air using their fingertips, with colors being detected and drawn on a live video feed.

## Features
- **Real-Time Painting:** Users can paint in real-time on a video feed captured by the camera.
- **Color Detection:** The application detects specific colors in the environment and maps them to corresponding drawing colors.
- **Multiple Colors:** Supports multiple colors for drawing, allowing users to switch between different colors on the fly.
- **Easy to Use:** Intuitive interface makes it easy for users to start painting immediately.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The project is developed using Python programming language.
- **OpenCV:** OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used for image and video processing tasks, including color detection and contour analysis.
- **NumPy:** NumPy is used for numerical computations and array manipulation, particularly in processing image data.

## Setup
1. **Install Python:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies using pip:
3. **Run the Application:** Execute the main Python script to run the virtual paint application:

## Usage
- Launch the application and position yourself in front of the camera.
- Select a color from the available options (e.g., yellow, blue).
- Use your fingertips to paint in mid-air. The application will detect your finger movements and draw the selected color on the video feed.
